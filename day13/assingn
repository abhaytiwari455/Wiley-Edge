Recursion
1.	Consider a group of n men arranged in a circle. Every k th man will be killed around the circle until only one survivor remains. Write an algorithm that finds the k position on this survivor.

2.	Consider a 5x5 grid with five defensive towers spread across the grid. To provide the optimal defence for the grid, we have to build a tower on each row of the grid. Find all the solutions for building these towers so that none of them share the same column or diagonal.

3.	Consider a sorted array of n elements that allows duplicates. An index k is magic if array[k]=k. Write a recursive algorithm that finds the first magic index. 

4.	Print all the valid combinations of n pairs of curly braces. A valid combination is when the curly braces are properly opened and closed. For e.g. For n=3, valid combinations are
{{{}}}, {{}{}},{{}}{}, {}{{}},{}{}{}

5.	A person walks up a staircase. They can hope either one step, two step, or three steps at a time. Count the number of possible ways they can reach the top of staircase.

Array
1.	Consider a string that can contain ASCII and Unicode characters ranging between 0-65,535. Write a code that returns true if this string contains unique characters. White spaces can be ignored.

2.	Write a program to rotate the matrix of nxn by 90 degrees in a counterclock wise direction

3.	Consider given n x m matrix of integers M. If M(i,j) is equal to 0, then the entire row, i and column j, should contain only zeros. Write a code to achieve this.

4.	Consider that you have been given array of integers, arr. Write several solutions that returns true if this array contains duplicates. 

LinkedList and Map 
1.	Given the n nuts and n bolds, consider one-to-one mapping between them. Write a code that finds all the matches between the nuts and the bolts with the minimum number of iterations. 

char[] nuts={'$', '%", '#', '&','@'}
char[] bolts={'@','#','$','%','&'}

2.	Consider unsorted linkedlist of integers. Write a code that removes the duplicates.

3.	Write the code that moves the last node of linkedlist to the first. 


Stack and Queues
1.	Consider that you have been given a String, containing the curly braces. Write a code that returns if there are matching pairs of the curly braces.
2.	Design a queue via two stacks
3.	Design a stack via queue. 
4.	Consider youâ€™ve been given a matrix m x n, containing only 0s and 1s. By convention, 1 means land and 0 means water. Write a code that counts the number of islands. An island is defined as a group of 1s surrounded by 0s.
